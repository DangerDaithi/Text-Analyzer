Disneyland Paris... the place where dreams are supposed to come true. But it was here in 2002, aged 16, that I collapsed, fell unconscious and had to be airlifted to hospital, where I almost died.

I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and faced living with a long-term condition involving multiple daily injections, finger pricks and much more.

France is where I was taught to inject insulin, in a language that I didnâ€™t speak, and spent what seemed like hours with a needle hovering over my leg as tears poured down my face, wishing the nightmare away.

That day signalled 10 years of self-neglect as I desperately tried to hide from my condition.

Initially I was frightened, angry and confused and the information that I was provided with in order to manage my diabetes was sparse and outdated.
